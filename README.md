Ludum Dare 36
====================

This is a game made in Unity. Eventually this template text will be replaced with a proper description... until then enjoy the mystery.

License
-----------

This code does not currently have a license. Until one is picked out it's probably safest to assume the source code here is for educational (and auditing) purposes. While bug reports are welcome, it's best you don't assume the code will end up with a proper open source license.

Build and Run
-----------

You will need the [Unity 5 Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/) (the free version is fine) to build this repository. A binary version may be provided somewhere else that can be run without installing the engine (check any webpages associated with this project). To open the project simply start Unity and point it to the root folder of this repository (you'll have to download or clone it). From there you can modify the game, or simply build a version for a platform binaries are currently not supplied for. Because this project does not currently have a license, you may not rerelease it, even with your own changes.
